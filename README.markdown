# JS Super Timer

A pure JavaScript timer that counts down hours, minutes and seconds to a given event.   
It works with an UNIX timestamp, i.e. you give the *timestamp* variable UNIX timestamp value to the date you want to countdown from. Then the script multiplies this timestamp by 1000 to turn it into miliseconds and the timer runs.   
## Very important

 Beware, only assign the *timestamp* a value that is in seconds, not miliseconds.
